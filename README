Configuration:

    Inpect browser_config.xml into the directory /etc/agile (you will likely need to create the directory "agile")

    Config file help:

        Inspect browser_config.xml located in the root dir.
        The pathPrefix tag indicates what the root directory should be for the targeted Agile customer users.
        if %username is left in the path string it will be replaced with the username of the authenticating user.
        This value needs to be properly set for the egress functions with the browser to work (preview file, download file, share links);
        It has no impact on what files will be visible to authenticate users, or on uploaded content!

        Example use-case:

        Agile customer "internetplus" would like to use agile browser.

        If all users of internetplus have access to the root directory of the customer directory structure the pathPrefix tag would look like this:
        <pathPrefix>/internetplus</pathPrefix>

        If however each user account has their own root directory then the pathPrefix tag would look like this:

        <pathPrefix>/internetplus/%username</pathPrefix>

        In this instance if user "bob" logs in his pathPrefix within the system will be set to /internetplus/bob once the config file has been properly modified

    Apache2 setup:

        Nothing special, just be sure to setup ssl.

    PHP Setup:

        In order to support file uploads php.ini will have to be modifed.

        Edit the following values:
            upload_max_filesize = 1000M
            post_max_size = 1000M

        Add the following values: (anywhere is fine, but I put them under the upload section)
            apc.rfc1867 = on
            apc.rfc1867_freq = 1K
            apc.gc_ttl = 259200
            apc.max_file_size = 1000M

    Copy/Move the contents of the package sans the config file to the path you want to host the site from.  (typically /var/www/<your_site>)
    Create a directory named "uploads" under the site root directory ie (/var/www/<your site>/uploads)
    Change the permissions on the directory to be writeable by www-data:www-data

    Once apache and PHP configuration is complete remember to restart apache


CSS / Branding information:

    "css/styles.css" can be modified for simple branding changes

    Replace the logo with your desired header logo.  Recommended size 300px x 100px with a transparent background
    Uncomment / comment out / modify the following styles:

    	.agile-label
    	#upload-help
    	.logo
    	.fileupload-content .ui-progressbar-value

    For your convenience 3 basic color options have been pre-created: green, blue and gray



Troubleshooting:

Note: Unless needed for logging / debugging PHP.ini should be set to ignore NOTICE level warnings.

Permission issues
* Make sure your uploads directory ie /var/www/agile_browser/uploads/ has the proper permissions.  user/group www-data should have full read, write and delete permissions.
* Agile browser performs some operations (like zipping and deleting local temporary files) which require "safe mode" to be turned off.  By default it should be.
* Make sure the smarty templates directory has rw permissions by apache (sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/agile_browser/smart/template*)

Upload issues
*Agile browser supports uploads of files up to 1gig in size.  Your PHP.ini file will need to be updated to support this functionality as well.
